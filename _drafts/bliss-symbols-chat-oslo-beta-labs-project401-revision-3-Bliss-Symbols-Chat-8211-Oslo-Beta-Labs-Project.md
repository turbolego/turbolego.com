Blissymbolics is a set of symbols invented by austrian Charles K. Bliss (1897-1985). His ambition was to provide the world with a universal system to communicate beyond linguistic barriers. The symbols are little pictograms or ideograms very easy to learn and to combine to create additional meanings.

There is currently one program i know of that can be used to chat with each other online using the bliss symbols (http://jfbouzereau.free.fr/BLISS/bliss0.html) but itâ€™s limited to platforms that can run .jar (Java) files and the jabber servers are currently down. (http://xmpp.net/bycountry.shtml)

Therefore, i want to use the power of ChatCodes to make a extension for google chrome, firefox and hopefully other browsers as well like opera and safari. This project will be open source and under the creative commons license.

The extension will allow people to use Bliss symbols in the facebook chat which is one of the most popular platforms people use to chat with each other.

The project is run by me, [Tobias Andersen](http://www.facebook.com/turbolego "http://www.facebook.com/turbolego") and [Nina Bauge](http://www.facebook.com/stikling "http://www.facebook.com/stikling") at Oslo Beta Labs.

More information will be posted here soon.
