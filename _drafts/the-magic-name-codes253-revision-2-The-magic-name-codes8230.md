So, because this was so popular, i‚Äôm going to explain in detail how this works‚Ä¶

On June 27, around 1 month ago, [Kirill Shulman](http://www.facebook.com/TheShulman "http://www.facebook.com/TheShulman") discovered that you could post a code in the comments, and it would magically transform into a name! üòÄ

So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs going on here?

It‚Äôs actually pretty simple, every user and page on facebook has their own user/page id‚Ä¶ And like most people know, you can tag someone in a post/comment by typing ‚Äú@‚Äù and then followed by the first letters of their name. A box will show with the name/pages starting with those letters, and you can choose the one you want.

Now, let‚Äôs take the code for ‚ÄúMark Zuckerberg‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äú@\[4:0\]‚Äù. And now let‚Äôs find Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs id‚Ä¶

Aha! so that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs id is ‚Äú4‚Äù so by typing ‚Äú@\[4:0\]‚Äù we are tagging the user/page on facebook with the id ‚Äú4‚Äù. Now let‚Äôs find the id for the ChatCodes page and my profile:

In short, to tag yourself or a friend or a page, do the following:

1\. Go to the profile/page

2\. Add ‚Äúgraph.‚Äù before ‚Äúfacebook.com‚Äù

3\. Take the ‚Äúid‚Äù number, and replace it with ‚Äúderp‚Äù in this code: @\[derp:\]

Here‚Äôs a picture you can share further to your friends:
