[17’th of May, Facebook released their Version 6 of the Facebook app for iphone and android.](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/facebook-app-for-iphone/ "http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/facebook-app-for-iphone/")

However, they did not release any methods for computer users running facebook in google chrome, firefox, opera, safari, Internet Explorer or any other browser!

So, [http://chatstickers.com](http://chatstickers.com "http://chatstickers.com") was made and a extension was created by [Velja Janković](http://www.facebook.com/theztech "http://www.facebook.com/theztech").

Here’s how it works:
