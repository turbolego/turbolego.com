Today, Taher Sellami decided to use[ the sourcecode from the extension by “Le Boss”](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/128742 "http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/128742") to make a new extension for a new set of PINK smileys! 😀

Bug reports: [spistek@yahoo.fr](mailto:spistek@yahoo.fr "spistek@yahoo.fr")

The picture to the right shows all the three extensions that are available right now, the download link is for the Pink smiley extension ONLY. 😉

If you just want one or two extensions, just disable or uninstall them. 😛
