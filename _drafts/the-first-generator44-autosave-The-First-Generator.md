When the album id discovery was revealed, [Lars Arne Svanes](http://www.facebook.com/Lanjelin.Svanes) made a generator to make the conversion from album links to chatcodes easier and faster: [http://facebook.expdvl.com](http://facebook.expdvl.com/)

All you had to do, was to insert the links to each picture in the webpage, and it would convert those links into chatcode.

[Svanes](http://www.facebook.com/Lanjelin.Svanes) also made a text-to-chatcode generator: <http://facebook.expdvl.com/?p=text>
