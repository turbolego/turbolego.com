Later on, [Michael Steiner](http://www.facebook.com/Stone19), found a trick to get rid of the white gaps between the pieces.

[Steiner](http://www.facebook.com/Stone19) figured out that if you pressed “\[alt\]” and then “08204” in Notepad, you would get an invisible character that could be used between the codes, instead for spaces.

A new generator was made by Gheorghe A. Iordachi with some help from [Lars Arne Svanes](http://www.facebook.com/Lanjelin.Svanes):

<http://giordachi.hostoi.com/fbsplit/> (currently offline)

Unlike the one made by [Lars Arne Svanes](http://www.facebook.com/Lanjelin.Svanes), this generator only needed the link to the album, and not each individual picture to make the code.

This was achieved with some regexp magic explained here by Lars: <http://expdvl.com/files/web/fbrep.php>
