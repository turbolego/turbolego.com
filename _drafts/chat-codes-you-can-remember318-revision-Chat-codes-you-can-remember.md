Usually, the chatcodes are something long and bizarre like “\[\[149269741885552\]\]” but there’s a way to make a chatcode like “\[\[chatcodes\]\]” for small smileys!

Here’s a small collection of some smileys with chatcodes you can remember:

Fuck you: \[\[midfing\]\] ![[[midfing]]](http://graph.facebook.com/midfing/picture "midfing")  
Dislike: \[\[iidislyk\]\] ![[[iidislyk]]](http://graph.facebook.com/iidislyk/picture "iidislyk")  
Rock sign: \[\[roxsign\]\] ![[[roxsign]]](http://graph.facebook.com/roxsign/picture "roxsign")

Peace sign: \[\[ipeaceu\]\] ![[[ipeaceu]]](http://graph.facebook.com/ipeaceu/picture "ipeaceu")

Green Grin: \[\[facegrin\]\] ![[[facegrin]]](http://graph.facebook.com/facegrin/picture "facegrin")

chatcodes: \[\[chatcodes\]\] ![[[chatcodes]]](http://graph.facebook.com/chatcodes/picture "chatcodes")

This is how this works: facebook has this rule that says you can’t have a nickname for your page unless it has 25 likes or more. My page for example: [http://facebook.com/chatcodes](http://facebook.com/chatcodes "http://facebook.com/chatcodes") was named [http://facebook.com/312080468826419](http://facebook.com/312080468826419 "http://facebook.com/312080468826419") before i got 25 likes and could choose a nickname…

So, in order to make these small smileys with an easy-to-remember code, you need the following:

1\. A page, just make one here: [http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php](http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php "http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php")

2\. A 180 x 180 pixel picture that still looks good when shrinked down to 16 x 16 pixels.

Example:

180 x 180:

16 x 16:

3\. Upload the 180 x 180 pixel picture to your page, and use it as the page profile picture.

4\. Get 25 likes.

5\. Go to “Edit page” and then “Update info”.

6\. Select a nickname/username:

Once you have found a available nickname/username, your page will be named like this: http://facebook.com/the username you selected

Now you can take your username, and put it in brackets like this: \[\[the username you selected\]\] and post it in the chat.
