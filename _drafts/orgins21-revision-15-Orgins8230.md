It was December of 2011, and i started the facebook-page [“Chat Meme Codes”](http://www.facebook.com/ChatCodes) where i asked people if they wanted to help me make some large facebook chat smileys…

Together, we made several facebook-pages, and used individual pieces of a picture as the facebook-pages profile pictures.

I used this webpage to split the pictures into smaller pieces: <http://www.htmlkit.com/services/is/>

This resulted in some awesome jigsaw puzzles that can be downloaded from the chat-codes library: <https://turbolego.com/L.txt>

Here’s how it works:

Every facebook-page (and every album photo) has their own individual code or name.

For example, here’s 4 pages that i used to make a 2×2 picture of the “awesome smiley”:

<http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-44/290126041033203>

The codes here are:

1×2: [295770667126779](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-14/295770667126779)

2×2: [129097450550741](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-24/129097450550741)

2×1: [225005317576273](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-34/225005317576273)

2×2: [290126041033203](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-44/290126041033203)

In order to display these pieces in the facebook chat, you have to put the codes in brackets like this:

\[\[[295770667126779](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-14/295770667126779)\]\] \[\[[129097450550741](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-24/129097450550741)\]\]

\[\[[225005317576273](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-34/225005317576273)\]\] \[\[[290126041033203](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-smiley-44/290126041033203)\]\]

The result:

My facebook page has enough users to get a name (and not a code):

[facebook.com/ChatCodes](http://www.facebook.com/ChatCodes)

If you place a page, group or person’s name in brackets, you will get their current profile picture in the chat:

\[\[[ChatCodes](http://www.facebook.com/ChatCodes)\]\] =

The whole process of making the “awesome smiley” can be seen on youtube as a video-tutorial:
