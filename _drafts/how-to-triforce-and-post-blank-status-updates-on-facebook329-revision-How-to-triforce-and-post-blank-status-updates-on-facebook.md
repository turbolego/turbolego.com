[knowyourmeme.com/ memes/newfags-cant-triforce](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/newfags-cant-triforce "http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/newfags-cant-triforce")

The method used in the article by knowyourmeme works on almost all webpages, but not in facebook comments and facebook statuses. It does however work in the facebook chat!

- Windows: \[alt-255\] \[alt-255\] \[alt-30\] \[enter\] \[alt 30\] \[alt 255\] \[alt 30\]
- Mac: \[option-space\] + \[option-space\] + \[option-J\] + \[enter\] + \[option-J\] + \[option-space\] + \[option-J\]
- Linux : \[Ctrl+Shift+U + a0\] \[Ctrl+Shift+U + a0\] \[Ctrl+Shift+U + 25b2\] \[Enter\] \[Ctrl+Shift+U + 25b2\] \[Ctrl+Shift+U + a0\] \[Ctrl+Shift+U + 25b2\]

Now, the problem is that the character alt+255 alone only works in the facebook chat, and not in comments/status updates, and thus using this method will make you looks like a newfag. The solution is to find a new invisible character that has not (yet) been disabled in the facebook comments/status updates.

The only character i found that worked, was the “ENQUIRY” character: [http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0005/index.htm](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0005/index.htm "http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0005/index.htm")

With this character, you can make a triforce by adding it in front of the two alt+255 characters, like so:

\[alt+0005\] \[alt-255\] \[alt+0005\] \[alt-255\] \[alt-30\] \[enter\] \[alt 30\] \[alt 255\] \[alt 30\]

For the blank status update, you only need to type this: \[alt+0005\]
