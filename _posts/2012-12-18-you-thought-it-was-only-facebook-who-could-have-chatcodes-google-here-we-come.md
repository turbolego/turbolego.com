And i‚Äôm now checking out possibilities for chatcodes on [google plus](https://plus.google.com/ "https://plus.google.com/"). I‚Äôve started a open group on google plus: [http://gplus.to/ChatCodes](http://gplus.to/ChatCodes "http://gplus.to/ChatCodes")

This is what i‚Äôve found so far of chatcodes-tools for the google plus chat is the following extensions for google chrome and firefox:

[![1](https://turbolego.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-244x300.png)](https://turbolego.com/you-thought-it-was-only-facebook-who-could-have-chatcodes-google-here-we-come/1-2/)[i2Symbol ‚Äì Emoticons, Smileys, Symbols Home page](http://www.i2symbol.com/ "http://www.i2symbol.com/")

[i2Symbol on the Google chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/i2symbol-emoticons-smiley/gponajbpomilcmbmfoipobkikeopjjhp "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/i2symbol-emoticons-smiley/gponajbpomilcmbmfoipobkikeopjjhp")

This extension has a lot of symbols that work in the google plus chat (and a lot of other places, too, like facebook!)

[G+ float chat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/g%2B-float-chat/mfdcnompihmoabomjngipdicppdfaibm/details "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/g%2B-float-chat/mfdcnompihmoabomjngipdicppdfaibm/details")

This extension allows you to have a bunch of G+ chat windows open wherever you want, and you can show/hide them by clicking on the small blue ‚Äúg‚Äù symbol in the top right corner in google chrome. It‚Äôs like MSN all over again. üòõ

These two extensions are the only chatcodes-related things i‚Äôve found so far, but i plan on investigting further to see if i can find ways to post full sized memes in the google plus chat.
