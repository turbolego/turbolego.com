I installed the new extension by Mohamed on google chrome in under 1 minute with just a couple clicks!

Firefox users still have to use Greasemonkey.

Check out Mohamedâ€™s blog for installation guide: [http://press-share.blogspot.no/2013/01/facebook-chat-emoticons-by-mohamed.html](http://press-share.blogspot.no/2013/01/facebook-chat-emoticons-by-mohamed.html "http://press-share.blogspot.no/2013/01/facebook-chat-emoticons-by-mohamed.html")

If you already have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey, go here to install the script: [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/140346](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/140346 "http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/140346")
